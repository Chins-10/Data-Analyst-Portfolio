# Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will provide a brief overview of data analytics projects, including the technology stack utilized to address each case.
# Decision Making for Mutual Funds: To Sell or Not Sell
+ Code: [code](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/project_code.ipynb)
+ Dataset: [data](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/index/comp/historical)
+ Description:
  + Processing the data and making training dataset and test dataset.
  + Using that training dataset to design a decision tree based on entropy criteria to make decision, to sell or not to sell. Then using test dataset to evaluate the performance in terms of precision, accuracy, and AUC-ROC curve. Also, displaying the decision tree and exporting IF-THEN rules from the decision tree.
  + Optimize the decision tree.
+ Technology: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
+ Results: Decision making for mutual funds, conclusion on to sell or not to sell, some of the performance parameters to make the analysis easier.
# Data Compression: Lossless Versus Lossy
+ Code: [code](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/p2_code.ipynb)
+ Description:
  + Performing Huffman coding to the two images respectively, and comparing the coded bits length with their entropy.
  + Performing Shannon coding to the two images respectively, and comparing the coded bits length with their entropy.
  + Performing Compressive Sensing to the two images, and plotting the decompressed images with different compression ratio.
+ Results: Compressing the data using lossless and lossy methods
# Course Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or while just having fun with code.
# Data Analysis Course
+ Description: This is a 6 weeks course by [Aptech Staffing](https://www.aptechstaffing.com/courses/). The course topics include Introduction to Data Analysis, SQL, Data Visualization using Python, Data Interpretation etc..
+ Repository: Check the repository having home-tasks and projects of the course --> [go to repo](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analysis-Course)
+ Status: Completed in April 2023.
# Learning SQL
+ Description: SQL queries for tasks from [Codecadamy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql), [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/),[Aptech Staffing](https://www.aptechstaffing.com/courses/), etc.
+ Repository: Check the repository having 400+ SQL queries --> [go to repo](https://github.com/Chins-10/Learning-SQL)
+ Status: Some of the courses are still in progress.
