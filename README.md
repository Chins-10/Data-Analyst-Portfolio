# Decision Making for Mutual Funds: To Sell or Not Sell
+ Code:[code](https://github.com/Chins-10/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/project_code.ipynb)
+ Dataset:[data](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/index/comp/historical)
+ Description:
  + Processing the data and making training dataset and test dataset.
  + Using that training dataset to design a decision tree based on entropy criteria to make decision, to sell or not to sell. Then using test dataset to evaluate the performance in terms of precision, accuracy, and AUC-ROC curve. Also, displaying the decision tree and exporting IF-THEN rules from the decision tree.
  + Optimize the decision tree.
+ Technology: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
+ Results: Decision making for mutual funds, conclusion on to sell or not to sell, some of the performance parameters to make the analysis easier.
